# Parallel system
This repo contains source code of project created for Parallel and Distributed Systems classes.

There are two implementations of n-body problem using Barnes-Hut algorithm. One uses MPI library for parallelism and MPE environment for profiling and visualization. The second one uses Berkeley UDP for parallelism and MPE environment for visualization.
